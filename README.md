# Notes on papers, research areas, etc

In an attempt to be more systematic and organized (since I realized I'm forgetting and then re-reading a lot of references), I started writing notes about research areas to one place.

So far, the organization of the notes is:
- general notes: a wider area of research (or programming) spanning multiple papers or topics
- references: just a mix of papers with small notes on their content & keywords

The writing is not perfect as I'm doing this very minimalistic (as much as I think I'll need to understand everything when I read it again).

I'm using pandoc & a mix of markdown / latex. Best read things are pdfs, the markdown files can be compiled into pdfs by running ./p.sh from each directory.
