# Notes on interesting papers and areas of interest

In an attempt to be more systematic and organized, I started writing notes about research areas to one place.

So far, the organization of the notes is:
- general notes: a wider area of research (or programming) spanning multiple papers or topics
    - Attention in neural networks: [[pdf]](general/attention/attention.pdf)
- references: just a mix of papers with small notes on their content & keywords
    - Summaries of read references: [[pdf]](references/references.pdf)
- reading-list: TODO for more thorough reading ^(probably never...)^
    - Reading-list: [[pdf]](reading-list/reading_list.pdf)

The writing is not perfect as I'm doing this in a minimalistic fashion (as much as I think I'll need to understand everything when I read it again).

I'm using pandoc & a mix of markdown / latex. Best read things are pdfs, the markdown files can be compiled into pdfs by running ./p.sh from each directory.


**TODO:**

1. Indexing / categorisation
2. List papers that are covered in READMEs
